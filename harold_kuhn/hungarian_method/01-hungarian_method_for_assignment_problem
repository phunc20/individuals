## 2. THE SIMPLE ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM
The simple assignment problem can be described as follows.

> There are a set of $n$ individuals and a set of $n$ jobs, where $n \ge 1$.
> Given a job, not all individuals are qualified for it. Assuming that there
> exists at least some individual qualified for some job, the problem states,
> "Find the maximum number of pairs of qualified (individual, job), where
> no individual does two jobs and no job is paired with two individuals."

The qualification can be packed concisely in a matrix, called **qualification matrix**.
For example, the following qualification relation
```math
\text{Individual}
\begin{cases}
  1 \\
  2 \\
  3 \\
  4 \\
\end{cases}\quad
\text{qualified for job(s)}
\begin{cases}
  1, 2,\,\text{and}\,3 \\
  3\,\text{and}\,4 \\
  4 \\
  4 \\
\end{cases}
```
can be packed into
```math
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix},
```
where
- the rows stands for the individuals
- the columns stands for the jobs
- the $1$'s in the matrix stands for qualification and the $0$'s for unqualification.

**Def.** An **assignment** refers to a non-empty set
```math
\left\{ (i_1, j_1), (i_2, j_2) \ldots, (i_r, j_r) \right\},
```

where $1 \le r \le n$ and
$i_k$ is a qualified individual for job $j_k$ for each $k$.

The matrix notation can also help express an assignment. Using the previous example,
if we assign
- individual $1$ to job $3$
- individual $2$ to job $4$
then we can express these as
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 1 & 1^* & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 1^* \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\

**Def.** An assignment is said to be **complete**, if there exists no more qualified pair (individual, job)
that can be added to it.
"""

# ╔═╡ fc4de50c-9c36-4290-b26d-3207ed420937

For example, the assignment just above the completeness definition is complete.

**Def.** An assignment is said to be **optimal**, if it is a solution to the simple assignment problem.

In particular, we can easily see that an optimal assignment must be complete.
"""

# ╔═╡ c5cb9926-1a8e-4c27-b35b-cdb87163098a

Still using the same example, if we
- move individual $1$ from job $3$ to job $1$
- move individual $2$ from job $4$ to job $3$
and then
- say, newly assign individual $3$ to job $4$
that is,
```math
\begin{bmatrix}
  1^* & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1^* & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1^* \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
```
then we achieve an optimal assignment.

Indeed, the above assignment can be written explicitly as
```math
\left\{ (1,1), (2,3), (3,4) \right\}.
```
Assume that this is not optimal, i.e. there exists an assignment of four or more
pairs. Then, since only job $2$ is absent from the above assumingly non-optimal assignment, the current assignment must include job $2$. Nevertheless, reading from
the matrix, we know that only individual $1$ is qualified for job $2$. Thus the
fourth pair is forced to be $(1,2)$, whence contradiction.

### Harder-to-Grasp Concepts
In what follows, we will introduce a few concepts and definitions whose raisons d'être are less obvious
than those definitions we've seen so far.

The reason for which these concepts are harder, I think, is that they are the crystallization of
Mr. Kuhn's analysis. The first of these concepts is that of a **transfer**.

### Transfer
However, before giving the definition, I'd like to attempt for a motivation. In the viewpoint of
improving a given assignment

- if the assignment at hand is not yet complete, then adding new qualified pair $(i, j)$ is a straightforward
  improvement.
- if the assignment at hand is already complete, exchanging the jobs among the individuals already in our assignment
  will lead us to nowhere, i.e. no improvement and still complete. Thus, in order to improve the situation, we
  must find a new unassigned job to which at least one of the individuals in our assignment is qualitifed. We are
  to shift such an individual to such a new job. This already starts to resemble a transfer.

**Def.** Assume that there exists an assignment
```math
A_1 = \left\{ (i_1, j_1), (i_2, j_2), \cdots, (i_{r-1}, j_{r-1}), (i_r, j_r) \right\},\qquad r \ge 0
```
and an unassigned job $j_0$ such that
```math
i_k \;\text{is qualified for}\; j_{k-1} \quad\forall\; k = 1, \ldots, r.
```
Then a **transfer** is an operator which carries $A_1$ to the following new assignment
```math
A_2 = \left\{ (i_1, j_0), (i_2, j_1), \cdots, (i_{r-1}, j_{r-2}), (i_r, j_{r-1}) \right\}.
```
More pictorically, we can represent a transfer by a graph similar to the following:
"""

# ╔═╡ 1b340dd7-a781-4aa1-9b44-de246e1d3b3b
md"""
**Rmk.**
1. In the above defintion, we have carefully reserved the possibility that $r = 0$. Indeed, we also call it a transfer when we do nothing to an assignment.
1. We have
   ```math
   \newcommand{\abs}[1]{\left| #1\right|}
   \abs{A_1} = \abs{A_2}.
   ```
   That is, the number of pairs remain constant
   before and after any transfer.
1. According to the remark above, not only an optimal assignment is complete, but also every assignment derived from an optimal one via a transfer is complete. _We shall see that this is actually an if and only if_, i.e.
   > An assignment is optimal if and only if it is complete after every transfer.

### Essentiality
**Def.**
Given an assignment, an individual $i$ in it is said to be
**essential** if $\exists$ a transfer which involves $i$.
Conversely, an individual $i$ in an assignment is said to be **not essential** or
**inessential** if no transfer involves $i$.

**Lemma 1.** For a given assignment, if an individual is assigned to a job,
then either the individual or the job is essential, and not both.


**Proof.**
The proof actually derives quite naturally from the definition of essentiality.

Assume that the individual $i$ in question is essential. Then we should show that the job $j$
that $i$ is assigned to is not essential. Since $i$ is essential, we know that $j$ is not
assigned to an inessential individual; thus, by definition, $j$ is not essential.

Conversely, assume that $i$ is inessential. Then we should show that $j$ is essential.
But this follows directly from the definition: $j$ is assigned to the inessential individual
$i$, so $j$ is essential.

**Corollary 1.** For all assignments, the number of individuals assigned to jobs is
equals the number of essential individuals and jobs. That is, in any assignment,
```
(# assigned pairs) = (# essential individuals) + (# essential jobs)
```


**Proof.**
It is not too difficult to see that
```math
\scriptsize
\begin{align}
    \texttt{(\# assigned pairs)} &= \texttt{(\# essential assigned individuals)} + \texttt{(\# inessential assigned individuals)} \\
                                 &= \texttt{(\# essential assigned individuals)} + \texttt{(\# essential assigned jobs)} \\
