## Factors
Let $X_{1}: \Omega_{1} \to E_{1}, X_{2}: \Omega_{2} \to E_{2}, \ldots, X_{k}: \Omega_{k} \to E_{k}$ be random
variables. A **_factor_** of **_scope_** $\{X_{1}, \ldots, X_{k}\}$ is defined simply as any function
$$\phi: X_{1}(\Omega_{1}) \times X_{2}(\Omega_{2}) \times X_{k}(\Omega_{k}) \to \mathbb{R}\,.$$

The following are a few examples of factors:
